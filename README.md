## **INTRODUCTION**

This project is an attempt toward a comparative study among six different machine- learning models for their accuracy in 
predicting the target class as well as their accuracy for predicting the probability of an individual belonging to the predicted 
class from the perspective of risk management. In this project, we summoned the “Default of credit card clients Taiwan 2005” 
dataset available at UCI machine-learning repository.
