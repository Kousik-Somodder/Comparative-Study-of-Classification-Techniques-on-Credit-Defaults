## **INTRODUCTION**

This project is an attempt toward a comparative study among six different machine- learning models for their accuracy in 
predicting the target class as well as their accuracy for representing the real probability of an individual belonging to the actual 
class from the perspective of risk management using the *Sorting Smoothing Method*. In this project, we summoned the **“Default of credit card clients, Taiwan 2005”** 
dataset available at [UCI machine-learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).


## **OBJECTIVE**

The sole purpose of this project is to compare the six machine-learning models, namely *Logistic regression, Discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbor, Support vector machine, XGBOOST and Artificial neural network* based on their accuracy of classification performane and effectiveness in representing the real probability of an individual belonging to the actual class.

 For assessment of classification accuracy, different measures such as classification error rate from confusion matrix, ROC curve and area under curve (AUC) are employed. For the assessment of accuracy of predicted probabilities, we’ll use the scatter plot of real probabilities of default(Y) vs predicted probability of default(x) from each of the six techniques. Then fit a linear regression line Y=A+Bx from the scatter plot and decide the best predicting model for which A is closest to 0 and B is closest to 1 and Rsq is highest.
